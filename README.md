# prophet3
a C based chess engine

Prophet is a console based program, but you can play a game with it using the 
Winboard (Windows) or Xboard (Linux/Mac) graphical user interface.  

http://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/


To build Prophet, you'll need a C++ compiler with SQLite3 development libraries.  
On Ubuntu that's libsqlite3-dev.  If you just want binaries, you can download them
from http://jamesswafford.com/prophet .
